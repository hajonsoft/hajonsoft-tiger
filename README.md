## We need your help!


HAJonSoft is a work in progress and needs a lot of improvement. There are unimplemented stuff waiting for your help! You can find them at github issue tracker or read the code and find @TODO tags! You can also subscribe to the development mailing list where we talk about features.

There are two areas you can help. If you code in ReactJs try to implement features for the website. If you are professional in Javascript and Node.js then you can help us by implementing external system interfaces with puppeteer.

We also would like to extend personal assistance and would like input around how to do that competently.

To start contributing, fork git repository from github, clone the forked repository and make your changes according to instructions below. Then send a pull request. We discuss changes you have made. After that you can see your changes merged in the main repository!
