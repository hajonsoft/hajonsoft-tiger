 ### HAJonSoft Tiger
 ---

Home for Nest suite of applications. Nest consist of Dove üïä  and Humming Bird combined. The code repo itself is called Tiger üêÖ (Animal). 
Repo uses an animal name while customer facing modules uses a bird name. I am starting to come up with names for every thing otherwise everything is called HAJonSoft and things starts getting confusing.

* Humming Bird (Bird) allows a Munazim to login and manage passengers, apply for visa, scan passports, create online advertisements, print reports, manage payments, etc...
* Dove (Bird) allows passengers to find trips, make a reservatoin, learn about the Munazim, etc...


To learn about HAJonSoft repos please watch this video [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9623964/121062683-40adc680-c77a-11eb-8cc0-7488bd23c13e.png)](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/obRrErJQBGMkwu6khqmUiZ?)


## Quick start
---

```
yarn start or npm start
```

## Copilot

Let's use copilot,  some tips are [here](https://travis.media/how-to-use-github-copilot-vscode/)

## Redux and Toolkit
---
For redux code walkthrough see video (public)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gl3-zDJ306pjZTFNpzU6rxknu-n1I-oT/view?usp=sharing
### Environment Resolution
---

To start Nest locally and connect to specific Munazim change src/firebaseConfig.js

ex. `import firebaseConfig from './firebaseConfigs/breno-tours'; `

Which will utilize breno-tours firebase account

_Note: This file will be overwritten during automated deployment but not if you `firebase deploy --hosting'_

# Commit format
---
I come a cross an interesting commit message format and I try to use it 
fix: To express a fix to the code ex. `fix: build error`
feat: To introduce a new feature to the code ex. `feat: apply for visa`
refactor: Code refactor ex. `refactor: apply for visa`
doc: Update to documentation only ex. `docs: spell check`
style: Update to style only ex. `style: apply for visa`
test: Create or update tests ex. `test: apply for visa`

_Sometimes this it helps me with the commit messages._

# Git and SSH
---
If you want to have two github accounts on your local machine, you can use ssh to manage more than one github account. Ex. work vs personal. here is a guide

https://medium.com/@pinglinh/how-to-have-2-github-accounts-on-one-machine-windows-69b5b4c5b14e

important ssh commands 
```zsh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
save it as  `~/.ssh/id_hajonsoft`
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_hajonsoft
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_hajonsoft.pub
open ~/.ssh/config
```

git remote set-url origin git@hajonsoft.github.com:hajonsoft/hajonsoft-tiger.git
git config user.name YOUR_USER_NAME
git config user.email YOUR_EMAIL

### Communication [Slack]

We use ZenHub to manage stories and epics. install ZenHub extension to see epics and stories right in your google chrome when browsing github.

Virtual standup is held on slack using `/remind me every [day/hour] at [time] to [your message]`

/remind #dev every day at 07:00 to 

Virtual standup :virtual-meeting ! If you want to share something with the team, please thread :thread with

1- What specific things did you complete yesterday and would like to share, and how would you briefly describe your approach to these things?
2- What specific things do you plan to work on today and would like to share, and how would you briefly describe the approach you intend to take?
3- What would allow you to go faster or do better?


_We‚Äôll meet in the #dev channel._

### Firebase
---
Munazim's authorize hajonsoft@gmail.com as an owner to their firebase account. You can login to any Munazim's firebase or Nest. To administer the project go to firebase.google.com and login using hajonsoft@gmail.com to find all Munazims and administer their firebase account.

The signup documentation is here https://github.com/hajonsoft/hajonsoft-react/blob/master/doc/SIGNUP.md

### Internationalization
---

We use i18n-ally extension instead of babel. This is a great extension and allows you to manage all translations from the sidebar.

To translate a string, simply select it, press COMMAND+P, find the command
i18n Ally: Extract text into i18n message
_I usually create a keyboard short cut for it as SHIFT+OPTION+COMMAND+T_
Follow the instructions to create an internationalization entry key, then use the key in your code. To translate, hover over the key inserted in the code and click the globe next to the language to translate. 

_Note: you will need to import t from the correct relative path. ex. '../../../shared/util/trans';_

_This is the easiest and cheapest solution I could find and I am having a lot of fun with it._

## We need your help!


HAJonSoft is a work in progress and needs a lot of improvement. There are unimplemented stuff waiting for your help! You can find them at github issue tracker or read the code and find @TODO tags! To contribute please send us an email hajonsoft@gmail.com

There are two areas you can help. If you like React then you can help implementing features for Tiger. If you are professional in Javascript, Node.js and/or web crawling then you can help us by implementing external system integration with puppeteer.

We also would like to extend personal assistance and would like input around how to do that competently.

To start contributing, either send us an email to be added as a contributer to the repo, or simply fork the git repo from github, clone the forked repository locally, make your changes. Then send a pull request. We will discuss your changes and once approved and merged it will deployed to all Munazims!
