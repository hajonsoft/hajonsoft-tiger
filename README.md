## We need your help!


HAJonSoft is a work in progress and needs a lot of improvement. There are unimplemented stuff waiting for your help! You can find them at github issue tracker or read the code and find @TODO tags! To contribute please send us an email hajonsoft@gmail.com

There are two areas you can help. If you like React then you can help implementing features for Tiger. If you are professional in Javascript and Node.js then you can help us by implementing external system interfaces with puppeteer.

We also would like to extend personal assistance and would like input around how to do that competently.

To start contributing, fork git repository from github, clone the forked repository and make your changes according to instructions below. Then send a pull request. We discuss changes you have made. After that you can see your changes merged in the main repository!
